## A CloudFlare Client API Application

### A few notes
I tried to explain everything I could in the app's UI. This app is also 
limited to what the Client API can do. No data on your Client API Key is 
saved on the server, as there is no backend. It is, however; saved in 
your browser for as long as you'd like it to.

### Technologies Used

 * HTML5 Local Storage
 * CSS3 Stuff
 * AJAX (a la XMLHttpRequest)

### How data is handled
All data is saved in HTML5 Local Storage, and can be evacuated on demand.
